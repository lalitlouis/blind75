Close, but it's actually the **opposite**! You move the pointer with the **smaller** height. Here's why:

## Key Insight: Move the SMALLER Height

**Rule:** Always move the pointer pointing to the shorter line.

**Why?** Let's think logically:

Say we have `height[left] = 3` and `height[right] = 7`:

**Current area** = `min(3, 7) Ã— width = 3 Ã— width`

**If we move the RIGHT pointer (taller line):**
- New area = `min(3, new_right_height) Ã— (width-1)`
- Since `min(3, anything) â‰¤ 3`, and width decreased
- **Area can only get worse!** ğŸ“‰

**If we move the LEFT pointer (shorter line):**
- New area = `min(new_left_height, 7) Ã— (width-1)`
- If `new_left_height > 3`, we might get a better area! ğŸ“ˆ
- We have **potential to improve**

## The Strategy:
```go
if height[left] < height[right] {
    left++    // Move smaller height
} else {
    right--   // Move smaller height
}
```

**Why this works:** We eliminate all possibilities where the shorter line stays fixed, because none of those can be better than what we already calculated.

Does this logic make sense? This insight turns an O(nÂ²) problem into O(n)!
